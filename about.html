About Me </b></h1>


Hi everyone! My name is Amy Huang, I'm currently a second semester junior living in Currier House concentrating in economics with a secondary in psychology and I'm originally from San Diego, California. Some of my hobbies include hiking, traveling and going to the beach! I used to be on the tennis but I medically retired this semester. 

Last fall, I took a leave of absence and lived in Taiwan for two months with a friend. This past summer, I did a month-long study abroad program in Tanzania where I saw a lot of really cool animals and got to camp in national parks. 

Here is a picture of me in Tanzania with some cool lions!
