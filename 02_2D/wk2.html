Week 2: 2D Design & Cutting </b></h1>

This weeks assignment consisted of (1) creating a press-fit construction kit (2) working through a Fusion 360 tutorial and (3) selecting 2 household objects, measuring them using calipers and modeling them in Fusion 360.

<h2 style= "text-align: center;">  
Part 1: Press-Fit Construction Kit (and stickers) </b></h2>

In this part of the assignment, I made a press-fit construction kit that could be assembled in multiple ways. In addition to measuring the thickness of my cardboard that I was going to laser cut, I also had to account for kerf. I had the idea of creating a sort of holder for my apple pencil so I measured the diameter of my apple pencil to create a circle in the middle of my design. 

My measurements ended up being (1) thickness: 4.4 mm and (2) *experimental* kerf: 0.2 mm.

Here is an image of my design that was prototyped using Fusion 360:

</div>

<p> This is the 3D version of my design visualized on Fusion. </p>
</div>

<h3 style= "text-align: center;">  
Laser Cutting! </b></h3>

I then used the laser cutter to cut out my designs and pieced them together. To start, I only cut out two pieces to see if I measured the amount of kerf correctly. Luckily, my pieces fit togther very nicely and very snug so I proceeded to print out 6 more pieces. I printed a total of 8 pieces. I put them together in this pattern (see below) and used it as a holder for my Apple pencil!

<h3 style= "text-align: center;">  
Stickers! </b></h3>

I also drew out and printed a sticker, which you can see below!

Part 2: Fusion 360 Walk-Through </b></h2>

In this part of the assignment, I walked through this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVFYrBClkPc" target="_blank">YouTube video</a>. I have attached an image below of my Fusion workspace following the YouTube video! 

<div class="image-text-container" style="margin-top: 20px;">
<img class="image" src="tutorial.jpeg" alt="screenshot" width="400" height="300">
<p> In the tutorial, I learned how to create lines, arcs, and ellipses. I also learned to use trim, construction lines, setting dimensions and applying constraints. </p>
</div>

<h2 style= "text-align: center;">  
Part 3: Modeling Two Household Objects </b></h2>

The two household objects that I chose for this part of the assignment are a roll of tape and a screwdriver. I started with the roll of tape since it was easier to model for me and I figured it would help me get a little more comfortable with Fusion. 

<h3 style= "text-align: center;">  
Measuring and Modeling: Tape </b></h3>

<p> This is the tape that I decided to model. </p>
</div>

<p style="margin-top: 20px;">Here are some images of how I measured my tape.</p>

<div class="image-container" style="margin-bottom: 20px; ; text-align: center;">

        <img src="tape4.jpeg" alt="Image 3" width="300" height="300">
    </div>

<p style="margin-top: 20px;">After taking measurements, I modeled my tape in Fusion and ended up with a final result that I have attached below.</p>

<h3 style= "text-align: center;">  
Measuring and Modeling: Screwdriver </b></h3>

<img class="image" src="sd.jpeg" alt="screwdriver" width="400" height="150">
<p> Here is an image of the screwdriver that I modeled. </p>
</div>

To start, I took measurements of all the parts of the screwdriver that I needed to model. Here is a collection of images that illustrate what I measured. 

<div class="image-container" style="margin-bottom: 20px; ; text-align: center;">
        <img src="measure1.jpeg" alt="Image 1" width="300" height="300">
        <img src="measure2.jpeg" alt="Image 2" width="300" height="300">
        <img src="measure5.jpeg" alt="Image 3" width="300" height="300">
    </div>

<div class="image-container" style="margin-top: 20px; ; text-align: center;">
        <img src="measure6.jpeg" alt="Image 1" width="300" height="300">
        <img src="measure7.jpeg" alt="Image 2" width="300" height="300">
        <img src="measure9.jpeg" alt="Image 3" width="300" height="300">
    </div>

After taking all of the necessary measurements, I began modeling in Fusion360. I have attached below my final 3D models of the screwdriver.

Final Notes and Thoughts </b></h3>

Overall, this assignment was pretty challenging as I think there was a huge learning curve for me to overcome while using Fusion. I tried using multiple techniques (and YouTube videos) to prototype the screwdriver but still ended up having to go to office hours for help. In regards to my model, it wasn't exactly proportional in regards to the curves on the handle and the screwdriver doesn't look as long as the one in real life, even though I used all of the same measurements. In the end, I had a great time learning how to use Fusion and I think I'm far more comfortable with it now!
