Week 6: Electronic Input Devices </b></h1>

This week's assignment is to (1) make a capacitive sensor (2) configure and use another sensor (3) include schematics of each sensor (4) calibrate each sensor and (5) prepare CAD files for CNC week. 

<h2 style= "text-align: center;">  
Part 1: Making a Capacitive Sensor  </b></h2>

For my capacitive sensor, I was inspired by Kassia's lab. I really liked the idea of making a "scale" with the copper sheets and a foam pad. 

Here's a list of the materials I used:
<ul>
    <li>Copper sheets</li>
    <li>Foam pad</li>
    <li>Alligator clips and wires</li>
    <li>Arduino board</li>
</ul>

My set-up ended up looking something like this (here's a picture of my setup and the schematics): 

<div class="image-container" style="margin-bottom: 20px; ; text-align: center;">
        <img src="copper1.jpeg" alt="Image 1" width="300" height="400">
        <img src="copper.jpg" alt="Image 1" width="450" height="300">
    </div>

In order to calibrate my sensor, I used a cup of water that had markings at every fluid oz. I started with putting an empty cup on my sensor, then I went up 2 ounces per weight in until I reached 8 ounces. 

Here's the code that I used in Arduino (this was taken from code given on the PS70 website): 

<pre>
    <code class="arduino">
        long result;  
int analog_pin = A0;
int tx_pin = 9;

void setup() {
    pinMode(tx_pin, OUTPUT);    
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    result = tx_rx();
    Serial.println(result);
}


long tx_rx(){       
                     
  int read_high;
  int read_low;
  int diff;
  long int sum;
  int N_samples = 100;   

  sum = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < N_samples; i++){
   digitalWrite(tx_pin,HIGH);              
   read_high = analogRead(analog_pin);     
   delayMicroseconds(100);                 
   digitalWrite(tx_pin,LOW);              
   read_low = analogRead(analog_pin);     
   diff = read_high - read_low;            
   sum += diff;                            
 }
  return sum;
}   
    </code>
</pre>

Here's a graph of my values from the serial plotter, plotted in Desmos with a line of best fit that's hand drawn in. 

<div class="image-container" style="margin-bottom: 20px; ; text-align: center;">
        <img src="copper2.jpg" alt="Image 1" width="450" height="300">
    </div>

As you can see, the data points taper off significantly and it's not a linear relationship. The line of best fit becomes practically flat when there's 8 ounces of water on it. There wasn't a huge jump from 6 ounces to 8 ounces.

Part 2: Light-Controlled LED using a Photoresistor </b></h2>

For the second part of this week's assignment, I decided to use a photoresistor and create a circuit where an LED's brightness adjusts according to the amount of ambient light. The goal is as the ambient light decreases, the LED's brightness increases, and vice versa. 

Here's a list of the materials I used:
<ul>
    <li>LED light</li>
    <li>Photoresistor</li>
    <li>1k and 10k resistor</li>
    <li>Wires</li>
    <li>Arduino board</li>
</ul>

Here is a schematic of my circuits:

<div class="image-container" style="margin-bottom: 20px; ; text-align: center;">
        <img src="schematic1.jpg" alt="Image 1" width="450" height="300">
    </div>

Here is the code that I used (after becoming more comfortable coding in Arduino, I coded this myself -- unlike the first part of this week's project!): 

<pre>
    <code class="arduino">
const int ldrPin = A0;
const int ledPin = 9;
int lastPressed = 0;

void setup() {
    pinMode(ldrPin, INPUT);
    pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
    Serial.begin(9600);  // Initialize serial communication at 9600 baud
}

void loop() {

    if(lastPressed + 100 <= millis()) {
      lastPressed = millis();
      int ldrValue = analogRead(ldrPin);
      
      // Print LDR reading to Serial Monitor
      Serial.println(ldrValue);

      int ledBrightness = map(ldrValue, 0, 1023, 255, 0);
      analogWrite(ledPin, ledBrightness);
    }
  
}
</code>
</pre>

I used the different brightness settings on the iPhone flashlight to calibrate my sensor and it worked surprisingly well. The first point on the graph is me putting a finger on top of the photoresistor. There also seems to be a non-linear relationship between the readings and increasing the input by one setting. It seems to taper off and flatten out as the lights were brighter. Here is a graph of my findings with a hand-drawn line of best fit: 

<div class="image-container" style="margin-bottom: 20px; ; text-align: center;">
        <img src="photoresistor.jpeg" alt="Image 1" width="450" height="300">
    </div>

I was really proud of the fact that my circuit actually worked so here's a gif of it in action!

Part 3: CAD files for CNC Week </b></h2>

This is a work in progress... However, I plan to make a sign that says "Phoenicians" on it.
