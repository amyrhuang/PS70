Week 1: Project Proposals </b></h1>

On this page, I'm going to be proposing some of my project ideas. I didn't come into this class with any ideas for what I want to build but I've got some working ideas. I went about brainstorming a final project idea by going about my day-to-day life and seeing where different "gadgets" or projects could fit in to make life more convienent.

Idea 1: Shoe Taker-Offer </b></h1>

My first project idea is a machine that "encourages" people to take off their shoes when they enter my room. This would involve a box that tells a person to take off their shoes as soon they enter the room, this would ideally be triggered by the door opening. The person entering the room would then be encouraged by the machine to put their shoes on a pressure plate to shut off the machine. If they don't take off their shoes in time, the machine would give them some sort of negative punishment. My first thought is a water gun that shoots them.

Idea 2: Mirror Cleaner </b></h1>

My second project idea is a window/mirror cleaner. My roommate and I share a bathroom and the mirror in our bathroom tends to have many water stains on it as the weeks go on. My idea is a mirror cleaner that clings to the mirror and cleans the mirror whenever it turns on. The idea is basically a Roomba for my mirror. It would spray Windex and then clean over it with sponges that are attached to it and move itself across the mirror.
