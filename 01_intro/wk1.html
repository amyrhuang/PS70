Week 1: Project Proposals </b></h1>

On this page, I'm going to be proposing some of my project ideas. I didn't come into this class with any ideas for what I want to build but I've got some working ideas. I went about brainstorming a final project idea by going about my day-to-day life and seeing where different "gadgets" or projects could fit in to make my life more convienent. 

<h2 style= "text-align: center;">  
Idea 1: Shoe Taker-Offer </b></h2>

My first project idea is a machine that "encourages" people to take off their shoes when they enter my room. This would involve a box that tells a person to take off their shoes as soon they enter the room, this would ideally be triggered by the door opening. So, for example, when the door is opened there would be a sound that plays saying something along the lines of "Please Take Your Shoes Off Immediately". The person entering the room would then be encouraged by the machine to put their shoes on a pressure plate to shut off the machine. If their shoes aren't on the pressure plate then the sound will not turn off. If they don't take off their shoes in time, the machine would give them some sort of negative punishment. My first thought is a water gun that shoots them. 

<h2 style= "text-align: center;">  
Idea 2: Mirror Cleaner </b></h2>

My second project idea is a window/mirror cleaner. My roommate and I share a bathroom and the mirror in our bathroom tends to gather water stains on it as the weeks go on. My idea is a mirror cleaner that clings to the mirror and cleans the mirror whenever it's turned on. The idea is basically a Roomba for my mirror. I'm not sure if a stick-on window cleaner would be feasible, I'm not sure how it would be able to suction onto the window as it moves around. Another option is that the window cleaner is attached to the window by strings or pulleys that are on the wall above the mirror. Again, I'm not sure how feasible this idea is. 

<H2 style= "text-align: center;">  
Idea 3: Weather Display Friend </b></h1>

My third project idea is a weather display friend. I'm constantly asking my friends/roommates what the weather is on a given day before checking the weather app. My idea is to create some sort of alarm clock-like box that displays the weather with cute cutouts. For example, if it's going to be sunny, a sun on an arm is displayed. If it's going to rain, a water droplet is displayed. Along with this, my weather display friend would show the temperature. The idea is to create a cute friend that displays the weather in the area that you're in.
