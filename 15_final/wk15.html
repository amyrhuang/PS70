 A Brief Box Background</b></h2>

I chose to pursue this project so that my roommate (not in video) would stop getting mad at me for asking her what the weather is (every morning). 

Many people have asked me why I don't just use the weather app. Here is a list of reasons. 

1. I don't like looking at my phone in the morning. It's too bright. 

2. I check the weather and then I forget what it is. And then I check it again. Everytime I check it, I have to unlock my phone and open the app. This is too much work. Now I can just look at a box.

Box Creation</b></h2>

All 3D printed components of my box were created with designs from <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a>. 

The box was created in San Diego (I went home) in a (homemade) woodworking studio with a friend and unfortunately did not document it.

However, it took me two hours to cut a hole in the box. See below for hole:

    </div>

Here are two images of my box during the creation steps. I ended up soldering the pieces and moved away from using the breadboard.

        <img src="fullbox.jpeg" alt="Image 1" width="350" height="500">
    </div>

I should have done better documenting the process, I'm sorry. Here's a gif of me soldering:
